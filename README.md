# GoFAST VoIP Server

<br>

## GoFAST stands for: Go (programming language), FreeBSD, Asterisk, SIP and Trunk

<br>

## GoFAST is a VoIP server that runs on FreeBSD, uses Asterisk as its SIP server and Go to provide a web interface. For uses who run Debian OS GNU/Linux versions of the files will be added as well.

<br>

## The GoFAST projects goal is to make a stable and minimalist SIP Trunk server that can be easly managed by a web interface.

<br>

## How GoFAST works:

- Authentication for the web interface is achived via client certificates generated with OpenSSL.
- Creating/removing/updating/deleting a SIP trunk in the web interface requires a 2FA code each time.
- FreeBSD is the recommended OS.
- MySQL or MariaDB is the database software.
- Nginx is the webserver software.
- Go is the language used to make the web interface.
- For the webserver certificates its recommanded to get a ECDSA certificate from Let's Encrypt with the curve secp384r1.
- The web server by default is set to only use TLS version 1.3 and cipher suite TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 for maxiumum security.
- TLS certificates used by Asterisk for encrypted SIP and RTP traffic are generated by OpenSSL and use RSA with key size 4096 on TLS version 1.2.
- The web interface and database make IP restriction on SIP trunks compulsorily.
- It is a minimalistic SIP Trunk server, there is no voicemail, no ring groups, auto attandents etc.
