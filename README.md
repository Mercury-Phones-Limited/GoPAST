# GoFAST VoIP Server

<br>

## GoFAST stands for: Go (programming language), FreeBSD, Asterisk, SIP and Trunk

<br>

## GoFAST is a VoIP server that runs on FreeBSD, uses Asterisk as its SIP server and Go to provide a web interface. For uses who run Debian OS GNU/Linux versions of the files will be added as well.

<br>

## The GoFAST projects goal is to make a stable and minimalist SIP Trunk server that can be easly managed by a web interface.

<br>

## How GoFAST works:

- Authentication for the web interface is achived via client certificates generated with OpenSSL.
- Creating/removing/updating/deleting a SIP trunk in the web interface requires a 2FA code each time.
- FreeBSD is the recommended OS.
- MySQL or MariaDB is the database software.
- Nginx is the webserver software.
- Go is the language used to make the web interface.
- For the webserver certificates its recommanded to get a ECDSA certificate from Let's Encrypt with the curve secp384r1.
- The web server by default is set to only use TLS version 1.3 and cipher suite TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 for maxiumum security.
- TLS certificates used by Asterisk for encrypted SIP and RTP traffic are generated by OpenSSL and use RSA with key size 4096 on TLS version 1.2.
- The web interface and database make IP restriction on SIP trunks compulsorily.
- It is a minimalistic SIP Trunk server, there is no voicemail, no ring groups, auto attandents etc.

### In this repository if a directory is appended with Debian or FreeBSD it means the files inside are speficaly for that OS. Some files are also appended with Debian or FreeBSD to distinguise between what OS there for.

### If a directory or file in this repository does not have FreeBSD or Debian appended to its name then it means it can be used on either OS.
